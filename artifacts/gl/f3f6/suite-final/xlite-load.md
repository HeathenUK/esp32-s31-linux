# xlite load arm

Each app and the GL libraries it loads, resolved with `ldd -r` (every
relocation, as musl binds) against our libGL + xlite libX11 + xstubs
libXext (+ xlite's libXrandr/libXxf86vm), built for the host from the
repo sources; libXi/libXrender are the host's, standing in for the
board's. LOADS means no undefined symbol; it says nothing about what
the calls then do.

| app | result | undefined symbols (library) |
|---|---|---|
| glxgears | LOADS | |
| glxinfo | LOADS | |
| glxheads | LOADS | |
| manywin | LOADS | |
| multictx | LOADS | |
| offset | LOADS | |
| glxgears_fbconfig | LOADS | |
| gears | LOADS | |
| morph3d | LOADS | |
| bounce | LOADS | |
| spectex | LOADS | |
| geartrain | LOADS | |
| ipers | LOADS | |
| terrain | LOADS | |
| tunnel | LOADS | |
| fire | LOADS | |
| teapot | LOADS | |
| texcyl | LOADS | |
| isosurf | LOADS | |

19 load, 0 would abort at load on the board.

These are gaps in xlite / the stub libraries (not libGL: every gl*/glX*
import resolves). Owners: xlite for libX11 names, xstubs for libXext.
